## Overview

SEO Assistant is a browser extension that analyzes webpages for SEO metrics. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles user data.

## Data Collection

**SEO Assistant does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

The extension operates entirely within your browser and performs all analysis locally on your device.

## How the Extension Works

When you use SEO Assistant:

1. **Page Analysis**: The extension reads the content of the current webpage (headings, meta tags, links, images, word count) to generate SEO metrics.
2. **Keyword Analysis**: Keywords you enter are analyzed against the current page content to calculate density.

All processing occurs locally in your browser. No data is sent to external servers.

The extension requires the following permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `activeTab` | Access the current tab's content when you click the extension icon |
| `scripting` | Inject the analysis script into the webpage |
| `host_permissions` | Analyze pages on any website you choose to analyze |
